## A Simple Explanation for Java SOLID principle

### Explanation

**Start Point**

The object-oriented design, I regard it as a viewpoint which reconstitutes the relation and interaction between real objects and software objects. (I majored in Aesthetics...) Then, there would be principles or _interfaces_ for the design.

**Tackling Curiositiy**

_SRP_: The Single-responsibility principle

_OCP_: The open-closed priniciple

_LSP_: The Liskov substitution principle

_ISP_: The interface segregation principle

_DIP_: The dependency inversion principle

The SOLID principle helps the code to be more understandable and mainatianable. Even though some posts point that _DIP_ is less important than the others for it is consequently achieved through _OCP_. However, with my thoughts, the _DIP_ suggests a critical viewpoint: the level of the code.

Deepdiving into the principles above would be my next duty.
